# Cooperativity - A new idea for national organization in both political and economic levels;

This idea came from a school project and a conversation during a car trip,
along with the observation of countless problems in today's world.
The objective here is to develop a new organization form that put more power in the hands of people;
that brings more resources to who needs it;
that offers everyone the basic for living;
that cherishes and nurtures good values in society;
that strengthens family bonds as common practice;
and a lot more.

If you are interested in knowing more about it and want to participate, please read the master branch.
There will be the oficial and updated version on this idea, called Cooperativity.
Keep an open mind (and heart) for new possibilities!

Thank you
